# Flex-and-Bison-based-Interpreter-and-Compiler


This project implements an interpreter and a compiler using the C programming language, along with the powerful lexical analyzer generator Flex and the parser generator Bison. 
The interpreter allows for the direct execution of source code, providing a dynamic runtime environment. 
The compiler, on the other hand, translates the source code into an intermediate or target language, enabling standalone execution.

Key Features:

    Utilizes Flex for lexical analysis, recognizing tokens in the source code.
    Employs Bison for parsing the syntax, generating an abstract syntax tree (AST).
    Implements a dynamic runtime environment for interpreting source code.
    Translates source code into an intermediate/target language for standalone execution.
    Supports a defined grammar for the source language, ensuring proper syntax adherence.
    Enables variable declaration, assignment, conditional statements, loops, and basic arithmetic operations.

  Intended Use:

This project serves as an educational tool to demonstrate the principles of lexical analysis, parsing, and code generation. It provides a foundational understanding of language processing tools like Flex and Bison, while showcasing their application in creating interpreters and compilers.

Technologies Used:

    C programming language
    Flex (Lexical Analyzer Generator)
    Bison (Parser Generator)

Note: This project can be further extended to support additional features, optimization techniques, and advanced language constructs.
